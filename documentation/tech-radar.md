# Tech Radar

The Tech Radar is a read-only governance view: it shows which technologies —
models, agentic patterns, knowledge techniques — the organization has decided
to adopt, trial, assess, or hold, next to the assets the catalogs already
describe. Decisions are managed in a single YAML configuration file; the
portal renders it and offers no write path, so governance stays auditable
through whatever review process already owns that file.

The radar deliberately carries **no links into the catalog**: it expresses the
organization's *target vision*, not what is currently deployed or in use.

## How it works

The radar is provided by the `tech-radar` plugin:

- The plugin reads the config file (default
  `/etc/naira/techradar/radar.yaml`, overridable via the
  `TECH_RADAR_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable) on **every** collect, so
  changes take effect on the next sync without a redeployment.
- A valid file becomes one `tech_radar` node (radar metadata plus the quadrant
  and ring taxonomies) and one `tech_radar_entry` node per entry.
- An invalid file fails the collect with errors naming the offending **line,
  field, and reason**. A failed collect never touches the store, so the
  previous radar stays visible ("last known good"). The errors appear in the
  plugin log and in the sync operation's error message on the Plugins page.
- Radar data is served by the standard catalog API — no dedicated endpoints:

  ```
  GET /v1/nodes?filter=kind="tech_radar"
  GET /v1/nodes?filter=kind="tech_radar_entry"
  ```

:::info
The catalog store is in-memory: after a catalog restart the radar (like all
catalog data) is empty until the next plugin sync runs.
:::

## Using the radar

Open **Tech Radar** in the portal. The overview shows the radar circle, the
ring definitions, the edition label, and the count of entries that moved since
the previous edition. Each quadrant links to a filterable table with every
entry's rationale, so the "why" behind each placement is always one click
away.

## Updating the radar

In the [dev environment](https://github.com/naira-project/naira/blob/main/deploy/dev/stacks/core/infra/kubernetes/catalog.yaml),
the config is mounted from the `tech-radar-config` ConfigMap. The ConfigMap is
mounted as a directory — not via `subPath` — so edits propagate into the
running pod (the kubelet syncs it within about a minute).

1. Edit the config: `kubectl -n idp-system edit configmap tech-radar-config`.
2. Wait for the kubelet to sync the mounted file (~1 min).
3. Trigger a sync from the portal's Plugins page, or
   `POST /v1/tech-radar:run` (or `POST /v1/plugins:run`).
4. Reload the **Tech Radar** page in the portal.

If the sync fails, the operation on the Plugins page shows the validation
errors; the previously synced radar keeps rendering until a valid config
syncs successfully.

Because the radar is driven by a plain mounted file, the mechanism composes
with any external GitOps tooling: keep `radar.yaml` in a reviewed repository
and let your delivery pipeline update the ConfigMap.

## Configuration schema

`schema_version` is required and must be `1`.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | yes | Schema version; only `1` is accepted. |
| `radar.id` | no | Radar identifier, defaults to `default`. Becomes the node path prefix (`<radar.id>/<entry.id>`). |
| `radar.title` | yes | Display title of the radar. |
| `radar.edition` | yes | Free-form edition label, e.g. `2026-09`. |
| `radar.owner` | yes | Owning team or board. |
| `quadrants` | yes | Exactly **4** quadrants, in display order. Each has `id` and `name`. |
| `rings` | yes | 1–6 rings, ordered **innermost to outermost**. Each has `id`, `name`, and an optional `description`. |
| `entries` | yes | The radar entries. Must be present — use `[]` for a radar without entries; omitting the key is a validation error, so an accidentally deleted block cannot silently wipe the radar. |
| `entries[].id` | yes | Stable identifier; with `radar.id` it forms the node path. |
| `entries[].name` | yes | Display name. |
| `entries[].quadrant` | yes | Must match a declared quadrant `id`. |
| `entries[].ring` | yes | Must match a declared ring `id`. |
| `entries[].moved` | no | `in`, `out`, or `none` (default). Movement since the previous edition. |
| `entries[].owner` | yes | Team accountable for the decision. |
| `entries[].rationale` | yes | Why the entry sits in its ring. |

All `id` fields must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$` and be at most 100
characters; ids become node paths, so oversized ids are rejected rather than
clipped. Unknown fields are rejected, so typos surface as validation errors
instead of being silently ignored. Entry order in the file is canonical: it
drives the numbering on the radar chart and in the quadrant summaries.

Free-form text is clipped rather than rejected, so an oversized value never
blocks a sync: short labels (titles, names, owners, the edition) are capped at
200 characters and long-form text (an entry's rationale, a ring's description)
at 2000, each with a trailing ellipsis and a warning in the plugin log.

## Out of scope

In-portal editing, historic editions, enforcement of radar decisions, multiple
radars per instance, and Git-based config sync are all out of scope for now —
the mounted-file mechanism composes with any external GitOps tooling.
